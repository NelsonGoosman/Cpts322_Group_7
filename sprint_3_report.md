## What's New (User Facing)
 * 2-Factor Authentication
 * Database Info
 * Testing
 * Frontend touch ups
 * Finished the view reports page

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we focused on getting the app wrapped up by splitting the final tasks and features that needed to be done. 2FA was integrated into the frontend to be fully functional. The database was finally setup to be able to fully receive info and send info to the server. We also finished the testing for the application to ensure all properties and features are working as intended. Finalized the "View Reports" page which gave access to data about the donations and users.

## Unfinished Work
N/A. The only unfinished work we would have would be more stylistic changes and updates to the application.
